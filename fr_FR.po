"The Cynefin framework made me realise how design, in what I consider its most valuable expression, ritually creates moments of crisis, "
"tapping into chaos to propose profound paradigmatic changes. In this book we make reference to the role of design and design practices in "
"mapping crisis and in moving out of uncertainty. We suggest how synthesizing our experiences within crisis into visual landscapes is a "
"precondition to start coherent action. In the illustrations, I tried to express how sometimes crisis transforms our most solid structures "
"into beautiful new entities."

"pratiques dans la cartographie d'une crise et la sortie de la zone "

"I first encountered Dave Snowden and his work on the Cynefin framework at an internal European Commission training event in early 2010. "
"Dave’s presentation was both inspiring and challenging. Inspiring because full of fresh ideas and provocations for my established way of "

"In the subsequent months and years, I spent quite some time listening to Dave’s podcasts, reading his blog and trying to feel my way towards "
"making good use of these concepts in my job. It seemed obvious to me that I should, yet I struggled to work out how. I went on an Cynefin "
"training course, to try to get a better understanding of the concepts, and I increasingly found myself using elements of Cynefin language to "
"frame my decision-making. For example, I found that asking whether this was a simple, a complicated or a complex problem helped me to "
"categorise things and adapt my responses accordingly. But I remained conscious that this was a very superficial use of a far more "
"sophisticated toolkit."

"When I was asked to lead the Commission’s IT Department in 2013, I reached out to Dave and got one step further forward, running an internal "

"strategy to improve customer solutions, yet we did not embed this more deeply into our way of doing things. Dave came to speak at our annual "
"IT conference in 2013 and got very positive responses, but overall my efforts to help “spread the word” remained an interesting side project."

"In 2016 I moved again, to run tax and customs, and my personal Cynefin path went a bit cold. I was still using the language to guide my "

"the Joint Research Centre’s EU Policy Lab, using design methods to map out my vision for the future development of the department. "
"Serendipitously, when I was asked to take on the leadership of the Joint Research Centre in early 2020, this connection created the path to "
"reconnect with Cynefin. I arrived as the pandemic was raging, and one of the very first conversations I had was with Alessandro and Dave, "

"One of the positive effects of the crisis is that it has forced policy makers to “think anew”. It has forced us to understand that we need "

"understanding and uptake of the usefulness of frameworks such as Cynefin in making sense of things. I wish I had had such a guide back in "
